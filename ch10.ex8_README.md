## Comments on ch10.ex8.py

Remarks:

1. Do all imports at the start of the file. Put the names of the modules you're importing in alphabetical order — all the standard libraries in one group, and after them all the "modules" that are programs of your own.

2. In your third for-loop, `for i in range(len(bDayList) - 1)`, I suggest two changes. First, use `zip()` to return all consecutive pairs of list elements. Example:

        zip(lst, lst[1:])

    Second, rather than using a counter `i`, it's more Pythonic to say something like

        for day in bDayList: ...

3. Also in that third for-loop, as you've written it, `sameDay` isn't being reset to `False` if it is not true that `bDayList[i] == bDayList[i + 1]`. But since `sameDay` is only used again in the following `if sameDay` line, I suggest you just increment `total` if `bDayList[i] == bDayList[i + 1]`, and dispense with `sameDay` altogether.

4. I've changed some of your variable names to be more readable — to allow things like `for trial in range(trials)`, for instance.

5. I think `bDayList` should be a list comprehension, rather than a for-loop plus append.

6. Your default argument `trial` is a reasonably large number, 1000. But since you're always calling the function with `trial=50`, I fear you may not be getting enough data to make the results come out roughly the same every time.

7. The way you are calculating the averages doesn't look correct to me. You're counting the total number of duplicates across all the trials in a single value of `total`. But actually, I think we want the average of each separate number of duplicates from each trial.

8. By the way, there is another way to count duplicates. You can compare a list `lst` with the same list passed as argument to `set(lst)` — a set removes all duplicates, so if you compare `len(lst) - len(set(lst))`, you have the total number of duplicates, without having the sort or use `zip`. I've added a second version of the function, using this method to figure the averages, and you can see I've managed to eliminate the `total` variable, too.
